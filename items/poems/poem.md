I HEAR AMERICA SINGING.

- I <small>HEAR</small> America singing, the varied carols I hear,
- Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe
- {:.indent-4} and strong,
- The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
- The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off
- {:.indent-4} work,
- The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deck-
- hand singing on the steamboat deck,
- The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing
- {:.indent-4} as he stands,
- The wood-cutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morn-
- {:.indent-4} ing, or at noon intermission or at sundown,
- The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,
- {:.indent-4} or of the girl sewing or washing,
- Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,
- The day what belongs to the dayâ€”at night the party of young
- {:.indent-4} fellows, robust, friendly,
- Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.
