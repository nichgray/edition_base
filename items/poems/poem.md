- I shall gather myself into myself again,
- {:.indent-4} I shall take my scattered selves and make them one,
- Fusing them into a polished crystal ball
- {:.indent-4} Where I can see the moon and the flashing sun.

- I shall sit like a sibyl, hour after hour intent,
- {:.indent-4} Watching the future come and the present go,
- And the little shifting pictures of people rushing
- {:.indent-4} In restless self-importance to and fro.
